## 💥 Common Kitchen Disasters & Fixes
### 1. Too Salty Soup
- **Fix:** add a peeled raw potato or unsalted broth; simmer 10 min.
- **Prevention:** season gradually & taste often.

### 2. Curdled Sauce
- **Fix:** remove from heat, whisk in a spoon of cold cream or ice cube.
- **Why:** gradual cooling re-emulsifies fat & water.

### 3. Tough Meat
- **Fix:** slice thinly against the grain; simmer in broth 5 min.
- **Prevention:** marinate with acid (vinegar / yogurt) & avoid overcooking.

### 4. Split Ganache
- **Fix:** blend in 1 tsp warm milk at a time until smooth.
- **Prevention:** pour hot cream slowly onto chocolate and stir gently.

### 5. Burnt Garlic
- **Fix:** discard burnt bits, add fresh garlic off heat, then re-oil.
- **Prevention:** cook garlic last and low — golden, not brown.
