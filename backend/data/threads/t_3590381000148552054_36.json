    "content": "To correct an overly salted dish like your curry, follow these steps for a quick remedy:\n1. Add more of the non-salt ingredients to dilute the overall saltiness without making the sauce too thin or watery. This includes vegetables and other components in your curry base that can absorb some of the excess salt.\n2. Introduce a peeled raw potato into the dish, which will help absorb some of the salty liquid through its natural properties as it cooks for about 10 minutes. Remember to remove and discard this afterward since you won't be consuming it with your curry.\n3. If possible, prepare a small amount of unsalted broth or water (about half a cup per quart of excess saltiness) and simmer the dish in that for an additional 10 minutes to further dilute the flavor without making everything too watery if needed after adding potatoes.\n4. As prevention, always season your curry gradually while tasting frequently during cooking so you can stop before it becomes overly salty."

    "content": "üç≥ Easy Scrambled Eggs & Tomato Bruschetta Plan (20 min) **Base:** bread, cherry tomatoes, garlic, basil leaves, olive oil. **Steps** - Prepare bruschetta base by toasting slices of baguette or ciabatta in a skillet with melted butter until golden on both sides (about 5 min each side). While bread is toasting:\n1. Dice cherry tomatoes and chop basil leaves finely, set aside. - In another bowl, whisk together eggs, milk or cream, salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg for flavor (about 2 minutes). **Swaps**: use mozzare0lla cheese in the egg mixture; try cherry tomatoes with heirloom varieties. - In the same skillet used to toast bread slices, saut√© minced garlic until fragrant for about 1 minute on medium heat (avoid burning). Remove from heat and set aside ‚Äî this will be mixed into one of your egg components later.\n2. Pour eggs over warm or hot pan with the reserved butter/oil to cook them slowly, stirring occasionally, ensuring they don't stick too much as you want soft curds (about 3-4 min). **Swaps**: use turmeric for color; add diced bell peppers and onions. - Once eggs are set yet slightly runny in the center if desired ‚Äî serve immediately over toasted bread slices, garnishing with tomatoes, basil leaves mixed into garlic butter (about 2 minutes). **Swaps**: use cr√®me fra√Æche instead of heavy cream for a richer taste; add diced avocado on top.\n3. For an extra touch and to keep it simple yet delicious ‚Äî drizzle with balsamic glaze or honey, if desired (about 1 minute). **Swaps**: serve over warm polenta instead of bread for a creamy base; add shaved Parmesan cheese on top.\n4. Quickly assemble and enjoy the freshness right away ‚Äî best eaten within minutes to maintain moisture in eggs and crispiness of bruschetta (about 5 min total). **Swaps**: replace tomatoes with roasted red peppers for a sweeter taste; add sliced mozzarella cheese on top.\n---"
