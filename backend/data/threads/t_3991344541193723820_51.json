Enjoy your cooking adventure with eggs and tomatoes!\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- **Base Ingredients:**  \n    *Eggs* – 4 large (50 g each)\n    *Tomatoes* - 3 medium ripe ones, diced (160 g total)\n    *Fresh Basil Leaves* - a handful (~20 g), chopped\n- **Additional Ingredients:**  \n    *Garlic Powder* – to taste (a pinch or 1/4 teaspoon, about 0.65 ml)\n    *Salt and Pepper* - to taste (adjust as needed; no specific measurement required for personal preference)\n- **Optional Swaps:**  \n    Use cherry tomatoes if you prefer smaller ones or have them on hand. Add spinach leaves instead of basil for extra greens, grated cheese like Parmesan can be sprinkled atop after cooking to add flavor and richness (about 28 g).\n\n**Steps:**  \n1. Crack the eggs into a bowl; beat them lightly with salt and pepper for seasoning, then set aside. Add garlic powder if using it as an alternative to fresh garlic.\n   \n2. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat (350°F / 175°C). Once hot, add the diced tomatoes and cook for about 2 minutes until they start releasing their juices but are not mushy. This helps to concentrate the flavors without making them too watery in your eggs.\n   \n3. Pour the beaten eggs over the tomatoes; let it sit undisturbed briefly, then gently stir with a spatula or wooden spoon until the bottom of the skillet is set and the top is slightly runny (about 1-2 minutes). If you're using optional swaps like spinach or cheese, add them now.\n   \n4. Remove from heat just before eggs are fully cooked to your liking; they should still be softly scrambled with a bit of creamy texture and slightly runny yolks for that restaurant-style finish (about 160°F / 75°C). This is also known as \"carryover cooking,\" where the residual heat will continue to gently cook your eggs.\n   \n5. Serve immediately on warm plates, sprinkled with fresh basil leaves for an extra pop of flavor and color (about 20 minutes from start to finish). Enjoy this quick yet sophisticated dish!"
