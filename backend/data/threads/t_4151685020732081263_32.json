    "content": "**Ingredients for Egg Curry (Kai Kari):**\n* Base Ingredients:\n  * Onions, finely chopped - about 1 large or 2 small.\n  * Tomatoes, diced - around 3 medium-s0 tomatoes should do the trick.\n  * Garlic cloves, minced - roughly 2 tbsp worth for a zesty kick.\n* Egg Curry Specific Ingredients:\n  * Large eggs (about 6) ‚Äì boiled and halved or quartered depending on preference.\n  \n**Instructions:**\n1. **Prepare the Base Sauce:** In a large pan over medium heat, saut√© finely chopped onions until translucent - about 5 minutes. Add minced garlic to infuse flavor and cook for an additional minute without letting it brown too much. This creates a sweet yet savory foundation that complements the eggs beautifully.\n   \n2. **Add Tomatoes:** Introduce diced tomatoes into the pan, stirring occasionally as they break down over low heat - roughly 10 minutes until you achieve a saucy consistency with no lumps remaining. The natural acidity of tomatoes will help balance out any bitterness from onions and garlic while adding body to your curry base.\n   \n3. **Seasoning:** Incorporate salt, turmeric powder (for a golden hue), chili powder or cayenne pepper for heat if desired - about 1 tsp each should suffice depending on taste preferences and the level of spice you're aiming for. Stir well to ensure even distribution throughout your curry base, creating that perfect blend of flavors without overpowering any single component.\n   \n4. **Cook Eggs:** While preparing a separate pan with boiling water (add salt if desired), gently place the eggs in for about 9 minutes to achieve soft-boiled perfection or longer for hard-cooked, depending on your preference ‚Äì this step can be done concurrently while you're cooking down tomatoes and spices.\n   \n5. **Combine:** Once both components are ready (with eggs halved/quartered), pour the prepared curry base over them in a serving dish or individual bowls, ensuring each piece of egg is well-coated with sauce for an even taste throughout every bite ‚Äì this not only adds visual appeal but also allows flavors to meld together.\n   \n6. **Garnish and Serve:** Sprinkle fresh cilantro leaves over the top, squeeze a bit of lime juice (for that extra zing), and serve immediately while hot for best results ‚Äì enjoy this simple yet delicious Egg Curry using tomato and onion!\n\nRemember to always adjust seasonings according to your taste preferences. This recipe is versatile, so feel free to add other vegetables like bell peppers or spinach if desired. Enjoy cooking with Chef CTS ‚Äì Core Culinary Notes üßë‚Äçüç≥!"
