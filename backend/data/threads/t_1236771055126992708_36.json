    "content": "üç≥ Quick Scrambled Eggs & Tomato Salad Plan: **Time**: 15 min | **Ingredients for Base Dish (Scrambled Eggs)**:  \n- 2 large eggs, beaten.   \n- Salt and pepper to taste.    \n- A pinch of paprika or chili flakes if desired.     \n**Steps**:    \n1. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the butter (or oil). Wait until it's melted, then pour in eggs and season with salt, pepper, and optional spices.   \n2. Stir gently as they cook to create soft curds. Remove from heat when done ‚Äî should still be slightly runny for a creamy texture upon serving.    \n**Ingredients for Side Dish (Tomato Salad)**:  \n- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved or quartered if large.   \n- Fresh basil leaves, chopped ‚Äì optional garnish.     \n- Olive oil to taste.      \n- Balsamic vinegar for dressing (optional).    \n**Steps**:  \n1. In a bowl, toss the tomatoes with olive oil and balsamic if using as dressing; season lightly with salt and pepper.   \n2. Serve immediately to enjoy fresh flavors or chill for later use in sandwiches/wraps.    \n**Substitution Idea (if needed)**:  \n- Use cherry tomatoes instead of regular ones if they're out of season; their sweetness complements the eggs well."
