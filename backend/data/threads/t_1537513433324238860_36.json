Let rest to avoid overcooking.   \n- Toast slices of bread, rubbed with garlic cloves; top each slice with halved cherry tomatoes drizzled with olive oil (5 min).  \n**Swaps:** Use whole wheat spaghetti for a healthier option or replace butter with avocado spread. **Safety Tip:** Ensure eggs reach 160°F / 71°C to avoid salmonella risk, use freshly cooked scrambled egg mixture immediately on top of bruschetta."
