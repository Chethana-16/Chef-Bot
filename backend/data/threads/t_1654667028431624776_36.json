Add drained spaghetti directly into the skillet, tossing it all together gently over low heat for about a minute more. Drizzle with olive oil if needed before serving hot!\n- **Swaps:** Use any leftover veggies; try adding bell peppers or spinach next time to bulk up your meal without extra prep work - they cook quickly too and add great color & flavor contrast."
