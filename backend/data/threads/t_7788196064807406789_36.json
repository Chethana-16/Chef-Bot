    "content": "**Too Salty Soup Fix & Prevention Tip:**  \n- **Fix:** Remove excess salt by adding a peeled raw potato or unsalted broth to the soup; simmer for about 10 minutes. The starchy potato will absorb some of the salty liquid, and you can discard it afterward if desired.  \n- **Prevention Tip:** Always season your dishes gradually and taste frequently as this helps avoid overseasoning with salt in future attempts."
